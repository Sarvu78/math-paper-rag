# Math-RAG: Interactive Research Paper Analysis
Navigating mathematics research papers often leads to a "citation rabbit hole." When a proof relies on a specific Lemma or Theorem from a cited work, researchers must manually find, download, and search through external papers—a process that breaks cognitive flow.

Math-RAG is an intelligent Retrieval-Augmented Generation solution designed to make the citation network interactive. By indexing both the primary paper and its references, it provides immediate access to the technical details you need, exactly when you need them.

## Future Work
Implement hierarchial retrieval logic, develop a more robust title extraction, implement rerankers, develop a front-end.
